       <h3>A Rich Man Story</h3>
       <p><pre>I can’t resist spending money lavishly over myself. I would adddifferent sports cars and 
               motorbikes to my collection. This collection would be a rare one nearly impossible to get.
               I will also construct a house for myself. My house would be filled with every beautiful piece
               of arts.It would have a swimming pool, a personal gym and different courts to practise
               indoor sports. For every place I will visit,I would buy a resident over there of my own. 
               This would give opportunity to visit there again and have a real good time.
               I am really fascinated by the thrill of extreme sports, so I will give it a shot to it.
               I really want to experience some of these like Skydiving, Paragliding, Snowboarding and 
               Cliff Jumping.

            If I were a millionaire, I could use my money todothings that 
            make me happy.I sometimes think, they way I’m thinking now, I would
            not have thought if I were a millionaire. My thought process 
            and perspectives would have been quite different probably. Anyway,
             the question is, what would be my plans if I were a
              millionaired.
